# New machine

This repo aims to give full step-by-step instructions (automated as much as possible) to set up a new development machine.
Parts can be skipped by commenting them out.

## Instructions

1. Download the repo (TODO: add a one liner that does this via curl or similar)
2. Set variables: cp config/variables.sample config/variables and edit
3. scripts/install
4. config/run
5. Set up zsh (TODO)
